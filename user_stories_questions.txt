Android live-coding user stories:

Branch: feature/classical-composers

User story 1:
As a pianist, I want to have a list of classical composers and their birthdays, so I can get an overview while choosing a new song to learn.
Acceptance criteria:
- A simple list with all composers is shown
- The list is scrollable
- The list is implemented using best practices for building well performing lists on Android

In-between question:
The Clean Architecture is broken in the `GetClassicalComposersUseCase`. 
What's wrong and how could it be fixed?

User story 2:
As a pianist, I want to have the birthdays of the composers in a smaller, colored text, so the list is cleaner and easier to read.
Acceptance criteria:
- The composer's names are displayed in normal text size and color
- The composer's birthdays are displayed beneath their names in smaller text
- The names have black color
- The birthdays have blue color

User story 3:
As a pianist, I want an option to filter the list of classical composers by entering a search query, so I can find interesting composers faster.

Acceptance criteria:
- A text-input field is shown
- Users can enter a search text
- The list shows only entries of composers whose names contain the entered string (in any position!)
- The list updates while the user types the search query
- An empty search query means all composers are shown

Nice to have functionality:
- The search is debounced (delayed) by 1 second, to make the list jump less while typing
